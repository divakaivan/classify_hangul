# Hangul classification app

Created on [Day 33](https://50daysml.blogspot.com/2024/02/day-33-tensorflow-deployment.html) of my journey.

Draw a Korean hangul character with your pointer and click `classify`.

Sample results (from previous version) (20/30 correct)

The previous version asked for a file upload, but the current one allows only for user input. 

Thanks to [this course by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment) for teaching me how to deploy a simple json model using javascript.
